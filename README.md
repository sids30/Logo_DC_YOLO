# Description
Computer vision project for YOLOV8 implementation.

# Objective
Recognize and distinguish the Durham College logo from the environment in each test image.

# Steps
- Open terminal or other command-line interface
- Clone YOLOV8 (ultralytics) to working directory
- Initialize a YOLO object with pre-trained weights file *yolov8n.pt*.
- Start the model training by specifying required parameters such as number of epochs (300) and patience (50)
- Save model to train directory
- Run test on the validation set and adjust previous values accordingly for performance.
- Run test on the testing set

# Results
The model accurately recognized the Durham College logo in most of the images presented in the testing set.

# Note
Only test photos (predict) are uploaded due to file size restrictions on GitHub.
